# Car-Sales-Analysis

## Business Objective:
The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard to effectively track and analyze sales performance in our car dealership. The dashboard visualizes critical KPIs and provides insights to help us make informed decisions and identify growth opportunities.

## Problem Statements:

### KPIâ€™s Requirement:
1) The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data, including Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales, Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales, and more.
2) It should enable us to monitor our progress, understand sales trends, and compare current performance with previous periods.

### Charts Requirement:
1) The dashboard should include various charts to visualize sales data effectively, such as YTD Sales Weekly Trend, YTD Total Sales by Body Style, YTD Total Sales by Color, YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region, and more.
2) These charts will provide a comprehensive overview of sales distribution, trends, and geographical sales performance.

## Key Features:

 **Dynamic Filters:** Users can filter the dashboard by date range, car model, body style, color, and dealer region to focus on specific segments of sales data.
 
 **Interactive Charts:** Charts are interactive and allow users to drill down for detailed insights by clicking on data points or using slicers.
 
 **Real-Time Report:** The dashboard provides real-time updates, ensuring that sales data is always current and reflects the latest transactions.
 
 **Detailed Grids:** In addition to charts, detailed grids are provided to view all relevant information for each car sale, including model, body style, color, sales amount, dealer region, and date.
 
 **Geographical Visualization:** Geographic data is visualized using map charts, allowing users to analyze sales distribution across different dealer regions.

 ## Approach:

Here's our approach for creating a powerful Car Sales Dashboard:

1) **Identify Metrics:**
Determine the essential metrics to track, such as total sales, average price, and cars sold.
Identify KPIs to measure sales performance, including Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales, year-over-year growth, and more.
2) **Data Acquisition:**
Collect comprehensive data on car sales, including sales volumes, prices, car models, body styles, colors, dealer regions, and dates of sale.
Ensure the data collected covers a significant period to provide meaningful insights into sales trends and patterns.
3) **Data Cleaning:**
Perform data cleaning to remove any missing or incomplete data and ensure consistency in data format.
Validate and verify the accuracy of the collected data to eliminate errors and inconsistencies.
4) **Data Modeling:**
Create a robust data model that structures the collected data for efficient analysis and visualization.
Define relationships between different data tables (e.g., sales data, car models, dealerships) to enable seamless integration and analysis.
Implement measures and calculated columns to derive additional insights and facilitate complex calculations within the data model.
5) **Design Layout:**
Create an intuitive and visually appealing layout for the dashboard, focusing on clear and concise presentation of data.
Organize the dashboard elements in a logical manner, with easy navigation and clear labels for each section.
6) **Data Visualization:**
Utilize a variety of charts, graphs, and tables to effectively visualize sales trends, distribution of sales across different parameters (e.g., body style, color), and other key insights.
Choose appropriate visualization types based on the nature of the data and the insights to be conveyed.
7) **DAX Queries:**
Develop DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries to calculate complex metrics and perform advanced data analysis.
Use DAX functions to calculate KPIs such as YTD sales, MTD sales, year-over-year growth, and more.
8) **Implement Interactivity:**
Incorporate interactive features such as filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities to allow users to explore data and gain deeper insights.
Enable users to dynamically interact with the dashboard and customize views based on their specific requirements.
9) **Ensure Accessibility:**
Ensure the dashboard is accessible across various devices and platforms, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Optimize the dashboard layout and design for responsiveness and compatibility with different screen sizes and resolutions.

By following these steps, we aim to create a comprehensive and user-friendly Car Sales Dashboard that provides valuable insights into our sales performance and helps drive informed decision-making.
